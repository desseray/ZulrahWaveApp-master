# ZulrahWaveApp

Zulrah Rotation/Wave Assistant

Hotkeys :
        1: Change rotation 1's frame
        2: Change rotation 2's frame
        3: Change rotation 3's frame
        4: Change rotation 4's frame
        0: Reset all rotations frames
        Esc: Bring up menu bar (to close program/move it around)
        
Things to note: 
The program is made to overlay everything else so you can interact with your client and still have the app in the front.


        

Using the APP:
Run the ZulrahWavesApp.exe and pres the esc key to bring up the menu bar and move the app to the desired position.
 Next press the esc key again to remove the menu bar. 

Each frame starts at wave 2 of each rotation because the first wave of each rotation is always the same (Center range phase).
In the second Zulrah phase press the number key correlated with the phase. For example if Zulrah spawns as the east range phase
press the number 3 key, the program will then remove the 1st, 2nd, and 4th frame allowing you to focus on the 3rd rotation.

However if Zulrah spawns as the center melee phase you can be either on rotation 1 or 2, so press the hotkeys 1 and 2 to switch both frames 
then do the same for the center mage phase (press 1 and 2 to cycle the frame), and then finally Zulrah will spawn as the west range phase,
or the south range phase, so press the correlated hotkey with the phase, and it will remove the other frames accordingly.

Finally, once you reach the 'back to start phase' (center range and indicated by the return arrow) press the 0 key to reset all the frames
 back to the second phasees again and repeat the process.
